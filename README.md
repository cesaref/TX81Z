# TX81Z

This repository contains the examples and samples which were used for the talk 'Emulating The TX81Z' at ADC 2024.

The patches are written in Cmajor - go to https://cmajor.dev to learn about how to run these. I recommend installing the VSCode Cmajor extension and running from there.

The final instrument is included in patches/TX81Z

There are some simple tests to generate output from the instrument, included in the repo, along with a script which was used to render the examples which appear within the test
